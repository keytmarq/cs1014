<!-- The horror.html introduces two chilling stories central to the game's narrative. The first story "Twisted Pathways", focuses on twin sisters Isabelle and Lily, whose inseparable bond is disrupted when Lily is separated by an unknown creature. The eerie atmosphere and suspenseful plot makes the story engaging, leaving players questioning whether Isabelle would succeed or fall as a another victim with the same twisted fate happened to her sister.

The second story, "Whispers in the Walls", promises a further descent into fear. This story likely builds on the haunting themes of the whispers suggesting unseen horror lurking in the shadows. Together these stories create a strong foundation for the game, drawing in players into a world of horror and fear.-->
